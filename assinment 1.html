    <h1>My Daily Routine</h1>

    <p>I start my day at <b>6:30 AM</b>. After waking up, I do some <u>yoga</u> and light <i>exercise</i> to feel fresh and active. Then I go for a short walk to relax my mind.</p>
    <p>After getting refreshed, I attend my <b>online or college classes</b>. I listen carefully and try to complete my assignments on time. In the afternoon, I revise my lessons and study the topics that need more focus. I also take out time to <i>read books</i> — mostly motivational or knowledge-based.</p>
    <p>In the evening, I go for a walk again to stay healthy. Later, I spend most of my time in <b>coding</b> and learning new programming skills. I try to solve problems, build projects, and improve my logic every day. Finally, I sleep on time so that I stay fresh and energetic the next day.</p>
